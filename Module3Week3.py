Loops

3. Write a ​for​ loop that will multiply all the numbers of a list together. Assume all of the items in the list are numbers.

 

4. Write a while loop that will print items from a list of strings. If a string is equal to 'end', 'quit' or 'exit', it should exit from the loop.

mylist = [1, 20, 33, 42, 54, 66, 81, 101]

Write code to a list of only the odd numbers
Write code to count the number of odd numbers
Write code to count the total size mylist
