## Dictionaries and Sets

## Dictionaries are similar to a list, but the order of the items doesn't matter, and they aren't selected by an offset such as 0 or 1. Instead, you specify a unique key to associate with each value. 

## Dictionary created by {}

val_agents = {
    "Jett":"uses knifes and wind!", 
    "Sage": "has an Ice element and heals", 
    "Chamber": "Sharpshooter that can teleport"
}
